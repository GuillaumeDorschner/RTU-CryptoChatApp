# Introduction

CryptoChatApp is a messaging application demonstrating cryptographic principles implemented from scratch. Without relying on external cryptographic libraries, it explores the fundamentals of **Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman** (asymmetric encryption) for key exchange and **AES** (symmetric encryption) for message security. Built using **React.js** and **Node.js**, the app supports real-time messaging through WebSocket. Refer to the [Message Encryption Flow](#message-encryption-flow) section for detailed cryptographic workflows.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: This project is for educational purposes and should not be used in production.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed on your system.

### Installation

#### Using Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/guillaumedorschner/rtu-cryptochatapp:latest
docker run -p 80:80 -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 ghcr.io/guillaumedorschner/rtu-cryptochatapp:latest
```

Then open your browser and visit `http://localhost`.

#### Clone the repository

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeDorschner/CryptoChatApp.git
   cd CryptoChatApp
   ```

2. Start the application with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Features

1. **ECDH**: Used to securely exchange the symmetric AES key between users.
2. **AES**: AES ensures message confidentiality by using a symmetric key derived from the ECDH shared secret.
3. **WebSocket**: Facilitates real-time encrypted messaging by relaying data between users, without requiring server-side storage of messages.

## Message Encryption Flow

The server acts solely as a relay and does not decrypt or store messages.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Alice (User)
    participant S as Server
    participant B as Bob (User)

    Note over A,B: Key Exchange Phase
    A->>S: Send ECDH Public Key
    S-->>B: Relay Alice's ECDH Public Key
    B->>S: Send ECDH Public Key
    S-->>A: Relay Bob's ECDH Public Key
    A->>A: Compute Shared Secret with Bob's Public Key
    B->>B: Compute Shared Secret with Alice's Public Key
    A->>A: Derive AES Key from Shared Secret
    B->>B: Derive AES Key from Shared Secret

    Note over A,B: Messaging Phase
    A->>S: Send encrypted message for Bob (via AES)
    S-->>B: Relay encrypted message for Bob (via AES)
    B->>B: Decrypt message using AES
    B->>S: Send encrypted message for Alice (via AES)
    S-->>A: Relay encrypted message for Alice (via AES)

```

## Cryptographic Concepts

### Why Use ECDH?

Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is chosen for its high security with smaller key sizes compared to RSA or traditional Diffie-Hellman, making it faster and more efficient.

### What is AES?

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for its speed and security.

### Common Issues with ECC

ECC, while secure, has implementation challenges and requires careful attention to avoid side-channel attacks.
